# Spotipy
Lets you get a csv on the artists you have across all your playlists

To use this, you'll need a "Spotify For Developers" account (https://developer.spotify.com/), along with the client ID and the client secret it gives you), along with the User ID of the spotify account you're looking at.
I think the only way to get this ID is by going to the profile page on the spotify website, and looking at the numbers at the end of the website url. So for example, the link to my profile is https://open.spotify.com/user/gaayf3eanokb5m14swk5qbol6, which makes my USER ID "gaayf3eanokb5m14swk5qbol6"
